// BOARD:JS -> SUMMARY
// set the default value in  Board.js´ summary section to the year we are currently in

// BOARDS.JS -> ADDENTRYFORM
//revise the AddEntryForm component to make the slide effect work in transition groups
// form should work :)


// fetching supabase table data at Navigation.js -> better at index.js?+


// in DetailsPage! the path can be duplicated if the user assigns the same title more than once. Solve this problem 
//(possibly by using the id next the path? uuidv()??)


/*

fix the navigation and its form. 
User should only be able to add sports via the form in Navigation.js 
that are not yet available in Navigation.js. 
Avoid potential duplicates in the navigation bar! 
If the user is about to create a duplicate, give him the information
that he should go to the sport via the navigation bar and then
click on “add entry”.
